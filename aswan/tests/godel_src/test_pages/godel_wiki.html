<p><strong>Gödel's incompleteness theorems</strong> 
    are two theorems of mathematical logic that demonstrate the inherent 
    limitations of every formal <a href="/test_page/Axiom.html" >axiomatic</a> 
    system capable of modelling basic arithmetic.  
    These results, published by Kurt Gödel in 1931, are important both in 
    mathematical logic and in the philosophy of mathematics. 
    The theorems are widely, but not universally, interpreted as 
    showing that Hilbert's program to find a complete and consistent 
    set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible.

<p>Employing a diagonal argument, 
    Gödel's incompleteness theorems 
    were the first of several closely 
    related theorems on the limitations 
    of formal systems. They were 
    followed by Tarski's undefinability 
    theorem on the formal undefinability of truth, 
    <a href="/test_page/Alonzo_Church.html" title="Alonzo Church">Church</a>'s 
    proof that Hilbert's <a href="/test_page/Entscheidungsproblem" title="Entscheidungsproblem">Entscheidungsproblem</a> 
    is unsolvable, and <a href="/test_page/Alan_Turing" title="Alan Turing">Turing</a>'s theorem 
    that there is no algorithm to solve the <a href="/test_page/Halting_problem.html" title="Halting problem">halting problem</a>.
