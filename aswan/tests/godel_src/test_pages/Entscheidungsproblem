<p>In mathematics and computer science, the <b>Entscheidungsproblem</b> (pronounced [ɛntˈʃaɪ̯dʊŋspʁoˌbleːm], German for "decision problem") is a challenge posed by David Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann in 1928. The problem asks for an algorithm that considers, as input, a statement and answers "Yes" or "No" according to whether the statement is universally valid, i.e., valid in every structure satisfying the axioms.</p>
